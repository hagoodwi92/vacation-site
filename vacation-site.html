  <h1>Vacationing at Crater Lake!</h1>
  <p>Here's everything you need to know about visiting crater lake</p>
</div>
  <p>Some of America’s greatest authors have waxed rhapsodic over the sight of Crater Lake’s blue waters. It’s the same view that compels people from all over the world to visit Oregon’s most popular national park site each year. And for some, the picture-perfect view of the calm azure waters is the final payoff for the trek to Southern Oregon and the winding road to the top of the collapsed volcano.

   <h2>Reasons to visit</h2>
   <p class ="bg-success">
   As I rub my aching feet, I envy these people. They sit on comfy deck chairs planted on the wide front porch of rustic Crater Lake Lodge, chatting or reading books. Every once in a while they look up, as if to make sure that, yes, one of the world’s most stunning views is still within sight.Those people didn’t bring their kids. I did, and while the sight of the rugged caldera walls rated a heartfelt “Sweet!” from my 13-year-old, it didn’t hold his attention for too long. After dumping our gear in our suite at the 71-room lodge, we found ourselves in the visitor information cabin checking out more active pursuits.</p>
